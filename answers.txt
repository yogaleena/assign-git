•What does fast-forward in Git mean?
•Why should you have different branches?
•In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Answers:
[1]Gitignore file include files or directories that are to be ignored when
 we commit to remote repositories in Java Projects.
[2]Fast-forward is done when you merge against a branch which is 
ahead of the the one that has been check-out already. In other words 
it means updating the Head pointer in the way where the new value 
will be direct descendant to the previous value.
[3]It allows developers to isolate their code by branching out from the 
original code base.
[4]We can list as many repositories as we want but there will be only
 one origin repository.
